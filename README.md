### Alterra Academy Batch 2
How to be an Ideal Top Search React JS Front-End Engineer. <br/><br/>
How to be an Ideal top search React JS Front-End Engineer program includes individual learning using the React JS programming language and a final project in the form of a team consisting of several specialized skills. In individual learning, each participant will take classes in asynchronous form (consisting of Pre-Preparation Learning by watching learning videos, doing quiz + summary materials, doing individual practical assignments and independent study watching learning videos) and synchronous form by participating in Live sessions where participants can consult with experts/mentors directly related to the material previously studied through the asynchronous type of learning.
At the end of the lesson, each participant will take a final exam in the form of making a final project and presenting their final project as a graduation requirement which will be attended by each of their Head of Study Programs / Supervisors to see firsthand the development of their students both in terms of technical skills and soft skills. <br/><br/>
In this final project, it is a combination of several of our programs, so that 1 group consists of 2 BackEnd Engineer students, 2 Front End Engineer students, 1 Mobile Engineer student, 1 UI UX Designer student, and 1 Quality Engineer student so as to help students get the experience they deserve. the world of work that requires collaboration, collaborative communication between teams, besides that students can implement the knowledge that has been studied previously by making a technology product based on real cases. <br/><br/>
During the learning process, a mentor will be accompanied by a mentor so that participants can better understand each material they learn so that participants can make technological products that meet the standards.
In addition, during the final phase of the project, mentoring will be determined based on the guidance schedule so that the progress of the tasks of each group is monitored and each group can still consult and get directions from the mentor.
